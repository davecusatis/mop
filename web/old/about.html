            <p>DSM, or DotStarMoney, or .*$, was derived as an inside joke while working on C-MAN's CMPSC 311 projects. Dave and Chris were equally lost so they teamed up to conquer. First project was a Unix shell script exercise using grep, sed, and regular expressions. While working on this project the duo discovered the be all to end all RegEx of ".*$", any character, any number of times, until the end of line.</p>
            <p>"'.*$' sounds like a cool name for a rap group" - Chris. Turns out it stuck enough for us to use it as the name of our team.</p>
            <p>Fast forward 5 months, concieved in Webster's Bookstore and Cafe, is an idea about a game about a spider... Dave and Chris decide make a game like no one has ever seen before. This is where Elliott comes in. Good games look pretty, Chris and Dave are by no means good at making things look pretty. The quest for an artist began, though we knew many incredibly talented people, Elliott was the best choice. The Trio hit it off from the beginning and have been plugging away on multiple projects, and undertakings, ever since.</p>
            <p>Fast forward another year, Chris and Dave are working full time, and decide to take a break, each of them working on other things, and continue development on Mop! the Spider in fall 2014. Elliott and Chris begin working on Nomera, a Russian Spy thriller about the mysterious UVB-76. Nomera is set for release for Holiday 2014, you can find more info <a href="nomera.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>We hope you enjoyed our brief history recap, we love games, we love making games, and we're going to release games that we love, and hopefully you do too.</p>

I don't like using tech that I didn't write myself, so I write my own engines and write my own editors. Being good at what I do affords me the luxury of writing modules and routines from scratch without a substantial time overhead. I also think Java is a stupid programming language for children. chris@dotstarmoney.com
